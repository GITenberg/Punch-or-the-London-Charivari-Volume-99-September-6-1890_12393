    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer</i>.)</h4>

    <h3>No. XVIII.&mdash;THE UNDOMESTIC DAUGHTER.</h3>

    <p>The race of daughters is large, but their characteristics,
    vocations, and aptitudes, are but little understood by the
    general public. It is expected of them by their mothers that
    they should be a comfort, by their fathers that they should be
    inexpensive and unlike their brothers, and by their brothers
    that they should be as slaves, submissively attached to the
    fraternal car of triumph. The outside public, the mothers and
    fathers, that is to say, of other daughters, look upon them
    vaguely, as mild and colourless beings, destitute alike of
    character, of desires and of aspirations. And it must be said
    that daughters themselves, before matrimony absorbs their
    daughterhood and relieves them of their mothers, seem to be in
    the main content with the calm and limited existence which
    their relations and the voice of tradition assign to them. Most
    of them after they have passed through the flashing brilliance
    of their first season, and the less radiant glow of their
    second, are happy enough to spend the time that must elapse ere
    the destined knight shall sound the trumpet of release at the
    gates of the fortress, in an atmosphere of quiet domestic
    usefulness. One becomes known to fame, and her friends, as
    being above all others, "such a comfort to her mother." She
    interviews the cook, she arranges the dinners, she devises
    light and favourite dishes to blunt the edge of paternal
    irritability by tickling the paternal palate, she writes out
    invitations, presides at the afternoon tea-table, and, in
    short, takes upon herself many of those smaller duties which
    are as last straws to the maternal back. Another becomes the
    sworn friend and ally of her brothers, whom she assists in
    their scrapes with a sympathy which is balm to the scraped
    soul, and with a wisdom in counsel, which can only spring from
    a deep regret at not having been herself born a boy, and
    capable of scrapes.</p>

    </div>

    <p>But there is often in families another and an Undomestic
    Daughter, who aspires to be in all things unlike the usual run
    of common or domestic daughters. From an early age she will
    have been noted in the family circle for romantic tendencies,
    which are a mockery to her Philistine brothers, and a reproach
    to her commonplace sisters. She will have elevated her father
    to a lofty pinnacle of imaginative and immaculate excellence,
    from which a tendency to shortness of temper in matters of
    domestic finance resulting in petty squabbles with her mother,
    and an irresistible desire for after-dinner somnolence, will
    have gradually displaced him. One after another her brothers
    will have been to her Knights of the Round Table of her fancy,
    armed by her enthusiasm for impossible conflicts, of which they
    themselves, absorbed as they are in the examination and
    pocket-money struggles of boyhood, have no conception whatever.
    The effort to plant the tree of romance in an ordinary
    middle-class household was predestined to failure. Her
    disappointments are constant and crushing. Desires and
    capacities which, with careful nurture, might have come to a
    fair fruit, are chilled and nipped by the frost of neglect and
    ridicule. Her mind becomes warped. The work that is ready to
    her hand, the ordinary round of family tasks and
    serviceableness, repels her. She turns from it with distaste,
    and thus widens still more the gulf between herself and her
    relatives. Hence she is thrown back upon herself for
    companionship and comfort. She dissects, for her own bitter
    enjoyment, her inmost heart. She becomes the subtle analyst of
    her own imaginary motives. She calls up accusing phantoms to
    charge her before the bar of her conscience, in order that she
    may have the qualified satisfaction of acquitting herself,
    whilst returning against her relatives a verdict of guilty on
    every count of the indictment. In short, she becomes a
    thoroughly morbid and hysterical young woman, suspicious, and
    resentful even of the sympathy which is rarely offered to her.
    In the meantime, two of her younger sisters are wooed and won
    in the orthodox manner by steady-going gentlemen, of good
    position and prospects. The congratulations showered upon them,
    and the rejoicings which attend them on their wedding days,
    only serve to add melancholy to the Undomestic Daughter, who
    has already begun to solace herself for her failure to attract
    men by the reflection that matrimony itself is a failure, and
    that there are higher and worthier things in life than the
    wearing of orange-blossoms, and going-away dresses. It must be
    said that her parents strive with but little vigour against
    their daughter's inclination. Her father having hinted at
    indigestion as the cause of her unhappiness, and finding that
    the hint is badly received, shrugs his inapprehensive
    shoulders, and ceases to notice her. Her mother, persuaded that
    sanity is to be found only on the maternal side of the family,
    lays the peculiarities of her daughter to the charge of some
    abnormal paternal ancestor. Having thus, by implication,
    cleared herself from all responsibility, she feels that she is
    better able to take a detached and impartial view of errors
    which, seeing they are those of her own flesh and blood, she
    professes herself utterly unable to understand or to
    correct.</p>

    <p>The Undomestic Daughter thus acquires the conviction that
    she herself is the most miserably crushed member of a
    down-trodden sex. In this, and in the agreement which she
    exacts from two or three melancholy friends, she seeks a solace
    for her sufferings. After a time, however, she discovers that
    this is insufficient. It must be said to her credit that her
    energies find the outlet of a passive sorrow inadequate. She
    burns to prove that one who is misunderstood and despised
    cannot only find useful work to do, but can do it better than
    her humdrum domestic sisters. Unfortunately, however, she
    overlooks the obvious and easy duties of her home. She scans
    the remote corners of the world. Her bruised spirit flutters
    about the bye-ways of charitable effort, and at length she
    establishes herself as a visitor, a distributer of tracts and
    blankets, and an instructor of factory girls. It is unnecessary
    to insist that these occupations are useful and praiseworthy in
    the abstract. It may be doubted, however, whether they should
    be undertaken by one who has to neglect for them equally
    necessary but less attractive labours.</p>

    <p>The Undomestic Daughter, however, rejoices in the
    performance of work, which, as it were, sets a seal to her
    wretchedness, and stamps her as a being apart from the ruck of
    her sex. She now takes her meals alone, and at her own hours.
    She probably breakfasts at half-past seven, and dashes out to
    interview the Secretary of the Society for Improving the
    Cultivation of Mustard and Cress on the Desert Patches of the
    Mile End District. After this she will hasten to Lambeth, in
    order that mothers residing in that teeming quarter of the town
    may be blessed with mittens and mob-caps, and returning thence
    she devotes an hour or so to lectures which are to make her
    expert in tending the ailments of humanity. Occasionally the
    family arrangements are upset, in order that she may have her
    dinner at an hour which will make it convenient to her to
    attend the meeting of an Institute for Reading Historical
    Novels to Working Girls, and her father will lose all his
    available stock of good temper on finding that the moments
    generally devoted by him to soup are occupied to his exclusion
    by the apple-tart provided for his busy daughter. Hence come
    more storms and misunderstandings. Paternal feet are put
    down&mdash;for a time, and neglected excellence pines in
    bed-rooms.</p>

    <p>Shortly afterwards the Undomestic Daughter discovers that
    nature intended her to be a hospital nurse, and she takes
    advantage of a period when her mother, being occupied in
    tending a younger brother through scarlatina cannot offer a
    determined opposition, to wring an unwilling consent from her
    father, and to leave her home in order to carry out her plan.
    This phase, however, does not last many weeks, and she is soon
    back once more on the parental hands. Thus the years pass on,
    the monotony of neglecting her home being varied by occasional
    outbursts of enthusiasm which carry her on distant expeditions
    in strange company. During one of these she falls in with a
    lay-preacher, who to a powerful and convincing style adds the
    fascination of having been turned from an early life of
    undoubted dissipation. She sits at his feet, she flatters him
    as only a woman can flatter a preacher, and having eventually
    married him, she helps him to found a new religion during the
    intervals that she can spare from the foundation of a
    considerable family. Warned by her own experience, she will
    never allow her daughters to be seen without their sewing or
    their knitting. Her sons will all be forced to learn useful
    trades, and it is quite possible that as time passes she may
    irritate even her husband, by constantly holding herself up to
    her somewhat discontented family as a pattern of all the
    domestic virtues.</p>

    <h2>PRIZE EPITAPH.</h2>

    <p>"A deep impression," said the <i>Standard</i>, last
    Wednesday, "was made on the hearers" (<i>i.e.</i>, Prince
    BISMARCK's audience at Kissengen) "when, in reply to a remark
    by one of the guests" (remark and name of immortal guest not
    reported), "the Ex-Chancellor said, 'My only ambition now is a
    good epitaph. I hope and beg for this.'" May it be long ere
    necessity imperatively demands his epitaph, good or
    indifferent, say all of us. But in the meantime, and to come to
    business, how much will the Ex-Chancellor give? Why not
    advertise, "A prize of &mdash;&mdash; (we leave it to the
    Prince to fill up the blank) will be given for the best
    epitaph"? With characteristic modesty, Prince BISMARCK, as
    reported, only asks for "a <i>good</i> epitaph." Why shouldn't
    he have the best that money can buy, and brains sell?
    Correspondents have already commenced: here are a
    few:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Beneath this slab the bones</p>

            <p class="i2">of this great boss are.</p>

            <p>Can Ossa speak? And would</p>

            <p class="i2">they say 'Canossa?'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>A would-be Competitor sends this,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Here lies BISMARCK&mdash;</p>

            <p>He made <i>his</i> mark."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>A Correspondent writes:&mdash;"I haven't an epitaph handy
    about BISMARCK, but here's one on a billiard-marker, buried, of
    course at Kew:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Rem acu tetigi,' let this attest,</p>

            <p>Now he has gone away for his long rest."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Yours,</p>

    <p>NIL DE MORTUIS."</p>

    <p>"P.S.&mdash;I'll think over the BISMARCK one, specially if
    he offers a prize of anything over a sovereign, as of course it
    ought to be, since the Ex-Chancellor always went in for an
    Imperial policy, which, however, didn't insure his life. This
    is very nearly an epitaph&mdash;praps you'll arrange it for
    me."</p>

    <p>Another says, "This is simple:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Ci g&icirc;t,</p>

            <p>P.B."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Yes, very simple, but not good enough. Perhaps our
    Correspondents will improve when the amount of the prize is
    fixed.</p>

            there,</p>

            <p>While, when the steward was not near, he struck

    <h3>SIXTH ENTRY.</h3>

    <p>Still endeavouring to earn an honest, but unpleasant, penny
    as a (temporary) Private Tutor. Begin to be vaguely conscious
    that my grasp of the Latin Grammar is not as firm as it might
    be. Will my classical training see me through, or will "ERNIE"
    see through my classical training?</p>

    <p>ERNIE (before breakfast) offers to conduct me round the
    grounds. Must take the youngster down a peg or two. So, when he
    shows me the stables, rather proudly, I remark,
    pityingly&mdash;"What! Only <i>three</i> nags?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, <i>I</i> ride a pony," he replies, airily. "What can
    <i>you</i> ride, Mr. JOYNSON? <i>Do</i> you know how to
    ride&mdash;or <i>do you generally fall off</i>?"</p>

    <p>Explain to him elaborately that I am rather more at home on
    horseback than on my legs. He winks, as if he didn't quite
    believe me. I can't go on, as it's certainly <i>infra dig.</i>
    to be praising one's accomplishments, especially to a chit like
    this.</p>

    <p>"We buried NERO here," the boy says, pointing to a damp
    mound. "He was our Newfoundland dog, and the gardener dropped a
    beam on him, and killed him as dead as JULIUS C&AElig;SAR. Oh,
    Mr. JOYNSON, <i>when</i> did JULIUS C&AElig;SAR die?"</p>

    <p>Happily my presence of mind does not desert me. I reply,
    severely,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What! Don't you know your Roman History better than
    that?"</p>

    <p>"No," he answers&mdash;"do you?" Then a sudden thought
    strikes him. "Oh, I'll ask Miss MYRTLE" (Miss MYRTLE is the
    Governess)&mdash;"<i>she</i>'ll be sure to know. <i>She</i>
    isn't a muff."</p>

    <p><i>Query</i>&mdash;What is the best line to take with a
    remark like that? Before I decide the point, HERBIE rushes out
    into the garden, and is immediately sent spinning into a
    cucumber-frame by his kind elder brother, who then disappears
    into the house.</p>

    <p>Yells from HERBIE. Go in and send the Governess to him.
    Relief from children for about ten minutes.</p>

    <p><i>At Breakfast</i>.&mdash;Mother cross. Seems to think that
    <i>I</i> ought to have prevented ERNIE from mutilating HERBIE.
    HERBIE appears with head bandaged, still sobbing. French again,
    thank Heaven!&mdash;so children silent. Never felt the
    advantage of foreign languages till now.</p>

    <p>Mamma, with a courage worthy of a better cause, asks me,
    "What time lessons will begin?" I reply, evasively, "that I
    shall be in the library, and that I will ring for <i>ERNEST</i>
    (I lay stress on the word ERNEST, as excluding the two others)
    when I am ready for him."</p>

    <p>I do, after a good preliminary smoke. HERBIE and JACK
    present themselves at the same time. I send them off to the
    Governess, and lock the door; Governess sends them back to me;
    result is, that they play about outside library all morning, so
    that we (ERNEST and I) can hardly hear ourselves speak.</p>

    <p>Put ERNIE through his paces. Ask him what he knows. Process
    (I fear) incidentally reveals to him what <i>I</i> know. Hear
    him at lunch explaining to HERBIE (with whom he has made
    friends again) that I am "not bad at sums, but a shocking
    duffer at Latin." Pretend not to hear the remark.</p>

    <p><i>Afternoon</i>.&mdash;Find the three boys, <i>and two
    girls</i>, all waiting&mdash;apparently&mdash;to go out for a
    country walk with me!</p>

    <p>What! Two-and-two! Never!</p>

    <p>"But&mdash;er&mdash;" I say, addressing the little girls, in
    a pleasant tone, "aren't you going out with your
    Governess?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes"&mdash;they both exclaim at once&mdash;"<i>she's
    coming too</i>!"</p>

    <p>The situation is becoming more and more embarrassing. I
    can't, in politeness, refuse the Governess's society for a
    walk. I solve the problem, temporarily, by telling all five
    children to run up to Miss MYRTLE, and ask her which way she
    thinks we had better go.</p>

    <p>They perform the commission with alacrity, which gives me
    the opportunity of slipping out at back-door, and taking quiet
    ramble by myself. <i>When</i> will Paterfamilias himself turn
    up? I have not seen or heard from Mr. BRISTOL MERCHANT yet.</p>

    <p>I am fated, however, to hear from him pretty soon; and, when
    I do, his communication is surprising. It comes in the form of
    a telegram, addressed to me. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Just heard President asked you to take tutorship.
    Misunderstanding. Very sorry, but have myself engaged another
    tutor. He will arrive this evening. Shall I tell him not to
    come? Awkward! Wire reply."</p>

    <p>Awkward! On the contrary, I feel it to be almost
    providential. Mamma doesn't apologise, but says,
    frankly&mdash;"Why, if he comes, there'll be two
    tutors&mdash;and <i>one is quite enough</i>!"</p>

    <p>I telegraph briefly to the effect, that, under the
    circumstances, I will go at once.</p>

    <p>Bid good-bye (after lunch) to ERNIE, in hall. He
    says&mdash;"I knew <i>you</i> would never do for the place,"
    and ought to have his ears boxed by his fond Mamma, but hasn't.
    As I go down front walk, see him and HERBIE and JACK all
    putting out what I think I may appropriately call their "mother
    tongues" at me from a top window!</p>

    <p><i>Moral</i>&mdash;for my own consumption: Never go to an
    uncultivated family again.</p>

    <p>So ends my Tutorship! And I've never once set eyes on my
    employer all through!</p>

    <p>After this <i>fiasco</i>, the President certainly ought to
    do something handsome for me.</p>

    <p>He does! Writes and says how sorry he is to hear of the
    stupid mistake that has been made. He knows of another very
    nice family, in Cheshire, who want a Private Tutor. Shall he
    mention my name to <i>them</i>? Not for worlds!</p>

    <h2>A PRODUCT OF THE SILLY SEASON.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>London at the end of August is not particularly inviting,
    save in one respect&mdash;it is negatively pleasant to find
    that <i>Matin&eacute;es</i> are all but suspended. I should say
    quite, were it not that the Shaftesbury Theatre on the 27th
    opened its doors at a quarter to three o'clock in the
    afternoon, for the performance of <i>The Violin Makers</i>, an
    adaptation of <i>Le Luthier de Cr&eacute;mone</i>, and the
    production of a "new and original Comedy sketch," in two Acts,
    called <i>The Deacon</i>, by HENRY ARTHUR JONES. The first
    piece I had already seen at the Bushey Theatre, with Professor
    HERKOMER, R.A., in the principal character. I had now an
    opportunity of comparing the Artist-Actor with the
    Manager-Actor, and must confess that I liked the former better
    than the latter. Mr. WILLARD as <i>Filippo</i>, was Mr.
    WILLARD, but Professor HERKOMER, shaved for the occasion,
    seemed to be anyone other than Professor HERKOMER. The mounting
    of the piece at Bushey was also greatly to be preferred to the
    <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> in Shaftesbury Avenue, and as the
    accomplished Artist-Actor had also supplied some exceedingly
    touching music to his version of FRAN&Ccedil;OIS COPPEE's
    Poetical Play, which was wanting two hundred yards from
    Piccadilly Circus, I was altogether better pleased with the
    entertainment served up with <i>sauce &agrave; la Herkomer</i>.
    I may be wrong in preferring the amateur to the professional,
    or I may be right&mdash;after all, it is merely a matter of
    opinion.</p>

    <p>Mr. JONES is entirely justified in calling <i>The Deacon</i>
    a "sketch," as it can scarcely claim greater histrionic
    importance. I think I may take it for granted that a
    sausage-maker, from the nature of his employment, is usually
    presumed to be a man not absolutely without guile, and,
    therefore, <i>Abraham Boothroyd</i>, "Wholesale bacon-factor,
    Mayor of Chipping Padbury on the Wold, and Senior Deacon of
    Ebenezer Chapel," may perhaps be counted one of those
    exceptions that are said to prove the rule. According to Mr.
    JONES, this eccentric individual comes up to town to attend an
    indignation meeting held with a view to protesting against the
    conversion of Exeter Hall into a temple of the drama, and after
    dining with "a <i>Juliet</i> of fifteen years ago," and a new
    and quaint sort of Barrister, accompanies them to the play, and
    is so greatly pleased with the performances presented, to him,
    that, before the curtain falls, he announces his intention of
    repeating his visit to the theatre every evening until further
    notice! This may be true to human nature, because there is
    authority for believing that the said human nature is
    occasionally a "rum un"; but, without the precedent I have
    quoted, it is difficult to accept the sudden conversion of
    <i>Mr. Boothroyd</i> as quite convincing. I could scarcely have
    believed that Mr. JONES, who has done such excellent work in
    <i>Judah</i>, and <i>The Middleman</i>, could have been the
    author of <i>The Deacon</i>, had not his name appeared
    prominently on the playbill, and had not a rumour reached me
    that this "comedy sketch" had adorned for years, in MS. form, a
    corner of some book-shelves. I think, if the rumour is to be
    believed, that it is almost a pity that there was any
    interference with that corner&mdash;I fancy <i>The Deacon</i>
    might have rested in peace on the book-shelves indefinitely,
    without causing serious injury to anyone. But this is a fancy,
    and only a fancy.</p>

    <p>I may add that Mr. WILLARD made the most of the materials
    provided for him; but whether that most was much or little is,

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>The Baron has recently been reading a new work,
    disinterestedly recommended to him by M. ROQUES, the French
    publisher and French bookseller of Bond Street, entitled
    <i>L'Ame de Pierre</i>, by GEORGES OHNET. It is a strangely
    fascinating story; the picturesque descriptions transport us to
    the very places; and the studies of life, are, specially of
    certain phases of French life, most interesting to an English
    reader. The cosmopolitan Baron DE B.W. wishes that Frenchmen,
    however manly they may be, were not so easily and so constantly
    moved to tears. This however, is only a matter of taste. What
    the purpose of the novel may be&mdash;for GEORGES OHNET has
    written this with a purpose&mdash;is not quite evident. Whether
    it is intended to chime in with the popular theme of hypnotism,
    and illustrate it in a peculiar way, or whether it is merely
    illustrating <i>Hamlet's</i> wise remark that, "There is more
    in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy," the
    Baron is at a loss to determine. It is psychological, it is
    materialistic, it is idealistic, it is philosophical, it is ...
    French. The <i>Vacuus Viator</i> may have a worse companion on
    a long journey than <i>L'Ame de Pierre</i>.</p>

    <p>Talking of materialistic, "let us," quoth the Baron, "be
    grateful to Mrs. DE SALIS for a bookful of '<i>Tempting Dishes
    for Small Incomes</i>,' published by LONGMANS &amp; Co." First
    of all get your small income, then purchase this book, for
    eighteenpence, or less with discount; or (a shorter and a
    cheaper way) borrow it from a friend. Let the Small Incomer
    cast his watery eye over Lobster cutlets, p. 19, and Lobster
    pancakes: let him reduce his small income to something still
    smaller in order to treat himself and family to a <i>Rumpsteak
    &agrave; la bonne bouche</i>, a Sausage pudding, and a Tomato
    curry. The sign over a Small-Income House is the picture of a
    Sheep's Head, usually despised as sheepish: but go to p. 28,
    and have a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> (<i>de
    mouton</i>) with Mrs. DE SALIS about <i>Sheep's head au
    Gratin</i>.</p>

    <p>Rabbit batter pudding, eh? with <i>shalot &agrave;
    discr&eacute;tion</i>. How's that for high? Let the Small
    Incomer get some dariole tins, mushrooms, chives, rabbits,
    tripe, onions, oil, ducks, eggs, and with <i>egg kromeskies</i>
    he'll dine like a millionnaire, and be able to appreciate a
    real <i>epigram</i> of Lamb (not CHARLES) and Peas. Don't let
    the Man with a Small Income be afraid of trying <i>Un Fritot de
    Cervelle de Veau</i>, simply because of the name, which might
    do honour to the <i>menu</i> of a LUCULLUS. "Blanch the Brains"
    for this dish&mdash;delicious!&mdash;"and fry till a nice
    golden colour." Beautiful! Nice golden colour like dear
    BLANCHE's hair: only often that's a BLANCHE without brains. And
    now your attention, my Small Incomer, to <i>Eggs &agrave; la
    Bonne Femme</i>. This work ought to be arranged as a catechism:
    in fact all cookery books, all receipt books, should be in the
    form of Question and Answer.</p>

    <p><i>Question</i>.&mdash;Now, Sir, how would you do <i>Eggs
    &agrave; la Bonne Femme?</i></p>

    <p>Perhaps this query might be preceded by general information
    as to who the particular "<i>bonne femme</i>" (for she must
    have been a very particular <i>bonne femme</i>) was to whom so
    many dishes are dedicated. [In the Scotch McCookery books,
    <i>Broth o' the gude-wife</i> would be a national name.]</p>

    <p><i>Answer</i>.&mdash;To make <i>Eggs &agrave; la Bonne
    Femme</i>, Mrs. DE SALIS says, "Get as many eggs as there are
    guests (they should all be the same size)&mdash;" Now this is a
    difficulty. It is not an easy matter to assemble round your
    table a party of guests "all the same size:" still more
    difficult is it to get together a lot of eggs all the same size
    as the guests. But, when this has been got over, read the
    remainder at p. 55, and then, as <i>Squeers's</i> pupils used
    to have to do, go and reduce the teaching to practice.</p>

    <p>The receipt for <i>Potatoes &agrave; la Lyonnaise</i> begins
    with, "Mince an onion, and fry it in hot butter"&mdash;O rare!
    Why do more? Who wants potatoes after this? And, when you've
    had quite enough of it, smoke a pipe, drink a glass of
    whiskey-and-water, go to an evening party, and then, if you
    won't be one of the most remarkable advertisements for <i>cette
    bonne femme</i> Madame DE SALIS, why I don't live in Baronion
    Halls, and my name's no longer</p>

    <p>THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;So many persons have sent in touching requests to
    the Baron only to notice their books with one little word, that
    his library table groans under their weight. To about a hundred
    of them that one little word might be "Bosh!"&mdash;but even
    then they'd be pleased.</p>

            <p>We sought it with search-lights, we sought it with
            care,</p>

            <p class="i2">We pursued it with ships and hope;</p>

            <p>But it seemed to have suddenly vanished in air</p>

            <p class="i2">From under the heaven's blue cope.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>We shuddered to think that the chace might fail,</p>

            <p class="i2">And TRYON, excited at last,</p>

            <p>Went ramping like redskin in search of a trail,</p>

            <p class="i2">For the ten days were nearly past.</p>

        <div class="stanza">

        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then Admiral TRYON he ramped like a lion,</p>

            <p class="i2">In prospect of splendid success.</p>

            <p>But the Snark, with a spasm, plunged in a sea

            <p class="i2">Of SEYMOUR one couldn't see less.</p>

            our ears,</p>

            <p class="i2">It seemed almost too good to be true.</p>

            <p>Then followed a torrent of laughter and jeers,</p>

            <p class="i2">Then the words, "It is all a

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then silence. Some fancied they heard in the air</p>

            <p class="i2">A sigh (from the lips of J.D.?)</p>

            <p>That sounded like "&mdash;&mdash;jum!" But some
            others declare</p>

            <p class="i2">It was more like a half-choked big

    <p>For the benefit of all tourists in Normandy, and visitors to
    Le Havre, Etretat, and all round and about that quarter, I gave
    an account, two weeks ago, of the excellent fare provided for
    us by <i>La famille Aubourg</i> at Gonneville. But on that
    occasion I made the great mistake of calling their curious old
    house&mdash;a perfect little museum of curiosities and works of
    Art&mdash;"a hotel." By my halidom! "Hotel," save the
    mark&mdash;and spend the shilling. "Hotel," quotha! "Hotel" is
    far too modern. Old English "Inn" more like. The kind of inn,
    good gossip, which was kept in SHAKSPEARE's time by "mine
    host," where everyone, with coin of the realm in his purse,
    could take his ease and be happy. So, to put me right on this
    matter, M. AUBOURG sends me a <i>truelle</i> of burnished
    metal, on which is inscribed, "<i>Hostellerie des Vieux Plats,
    Souvenir d'Aubourg</i>," which <i>truelle</i>, if not large,
    "yet will serve" to help fish, or <i>pommes
    souffl&eacute;es</i>, or <i>pommes Anna</i>, and, mark ye, my
    masters, will also serve to recall to my memory a right merrie,
    even tho' 'twere an all too short, holiday.</p>

    <h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I Was aware that Mr. J. was a semolina-brained impostor, but
    I should never have conceived that even he, the jelly-faced
    chief of the chowder-heads, could have attained to such a pitch
    of folly as to inform me that "the <i>Prix Montyon</i> is not a
    medal, and cannot be worn at Court." These are his words. Did I
    ever say it was a medal? I remarked that the QUEEN had given me
    permission to wear it at Court. That is true. But I never said
    that I would or could so wear it. As for Her Most Gracious
    Majesty's permission, it was conveyed to me in a document
    beginning, "VICTORIA, by the grace of," &amp;c, and containing
    the signature of Lord HALSBURY, the Lord Chancellor&mdash;No,
    by the way, that is another Royal communication. The Permission
    begins, "To our right trusty and well-beloved." What beautiful,
    confiding, affectionate words are these! Who can wonder that a
    Queen who habitually makes use of them should reign in the
    hearts of her subjects?</p>

    <p>Since I returned from France I have been on a further and
    more extensive Continental tour, and have received more marks
    of distinction from various Crowned Heads. Did you hear the
    strange story of what took place at the meeting of the German
    EMPEROR with the CZAR of Russia? It was the hour of the mid-day
    meal. The EMPEROR, at the head of his Wyborg Regiment, had
    performed prodigies of valour. Mounted on his fiery
    <i>Tchinovick</i> (a Circassian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> mustang) he had ridden into
       the heart of the hostile position, and with one stroke of
       his <i>Pen</i> (a sort of Russian scimetar with a jewelled
       hilt) he had captured a convoy containing three thousand
       <i>Versts</i> (a sort of condensed food), intended for the
       consumption of the opposing Army. Tired with his labours, he
       was now lying at full length beside his Imperial host on the
       banks of the torrential Narva. The CZAR, in attempting to
       open, a Champagne bottle, had just broken one of his
       Imperial nails, and had despatched his chief butler to
       Siberia, observing with pleasant irony, that he would no
       doubt find a corkscrew there. At this moment a tall and
       aristocratic stranger, mounted upon a high-spirited native
       <i>Mokeoffskaia</i>, dashed up at full gallop. To announce
       himself as Lieutenant-General POPOFF, to seize the
       refractory bottle, to draw the cork, and pour the foaming
       liquid into the Imperial glasses, was for him the work of a
       moment. That stranger was I. In recognition of my
       promptitude, <i>the</i> CZAR has conferred upon me the
       Stewardship of the Vistula Hundreds, with the command of a
       division of the Yeomanoff Cavalry, the most distinguished
       horse-soldiers in Europe.</p>

    <p>The German EMPEROR was equally impressed. His Majesty
    smiled, and, turning to General CAPRIVI, told him to consider
    himself henceforth under my orders for everything that
    concerned the peace of the world. I could see that CAPRIVI did
    not relish this, but I soon made him know his place, and when I
    threatened to send for Prince BISMARCK&mdash;who, by the way,
    has granted me the unique honour of an interview&mdash;he
    became quite calm and reasonable. On my way home, I called in
    on Prince FERDINAND of Bulgaria, <i>who offered me his
    Crown</i>, telling me at the same time that he intended to take
    a course of German Baths. He said I should find STAMBOULOFF a
    very pleasant fellow; "but," he added, "you've got to know him
    first."</p>

    <p>I, of course, refused His Highness's offer, and accepted
    instead the Cross for Valour on the Field of Battle. I then
    hurried off to Servia. King MILAN informed me that, if I wished
    to take a Queen back with me to England, he would dispose of
    one very cheaply. Having advised the Regents as to the best
    method of governing the country, I departed for Roumania. The
    Queen of ROUMANIA welcomed me as a literary man. She writes all
    the Roumanian sporting prophecies in verse. The King invested
    me at once with the <i>Stonibroku</i> Order in brilliants, with
    the <i>Iohu</i> Clasp for special promise shown in connection
    with turf literature. I may assure you in confidence that there
    will be no war for the next week or two. This result is
    entirely due to me.</p>

    <p>Do you want to hear about the St. Leger? I need only say
    that my own <i>Surefoot</i> has brought me <i>Alloway
    Heaume</i>. Whilst in Russia I heard about plenty of
    <i>Serfs</i>, but they were not saints. Anybody who proposes to
    wear a <i>Blue-green</i> waistcoat on the <i>Queen's
    Birthday</i> ought to eat <i>Sainfoin</i> for the rest of his
    life, and be taken <i>Right Away</i>. Finally, if <i>The
    Field</i> is to <i>Memoir</i> as a window-sash is to a
    Duchess's flounces, what chance has a crack-brained Bedlamite
    of munching potatoes in St. James's Palace? Answers must he
    posted not later than Monday. All prizes genuine. No
    blanks.</p>

    <p>Yours as always, GENERAL POPOFF.</p>

    <p><i>Captain Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>, Comic Opera. Music by
    ROBERT PLANQUETTE, composer of <i>Paul Jones</i> and <i>Les
    Cloches de Corneville</i>. Book by Messrs. BISSON and BURNAND;
    GILBERT &Agrave; BECKETT assisting in the lyrics. The Carl Rosa
    Company, DRURIOLANO IMPERATORE, wouldn't wait for the
    production of an Opera in Paris in order to bring it out here
    with the French <i>cachet</i>, but determined to have one done
    all for themselves, and to bring it out here first. So the
    French author began it, the English one finished it, and the
    Composer wrote music for original French and original English
    words. It is an international Opera; a new departure, and in
    the Operatic world an important one. It answers a question
    which was once the question of the day, "Why should London
    wait?" London, represented by Sheriff DRURIOLANUS, did not
    wait, and was served immediately with <i>Captain
    Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>, produced Monday the 25th, at the
    Prince of Wales's Theatre; and the gratitude of London has
    justified the generosity of all concerned behind the Curtain,
    and in front of the house. Even in August the five million odd
    of those left in Town can appreciate good music, capital
    acting, magnificent dresses, and perfect
    <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>. The Prince of Wales's Theatre has
    a reputation for level excellence in Comic Opera&mdash;it is
    the <i>sp&eacute;cialit&eacute; de la maison</i>, and the new
    lyrical piece is a worthy successor to <i>Dorothy,
    Marjorie</i>, and <i>Paul Jones</i>. As <i>Captain
    Th&eacute;r&egrave;se</i>, Miss ATTALLIE CLAIRE reminds mature
    playgoers of that "such a little Admiral" that was irresistible
    many years ago. She is bright, clever, and, above all, refined.
    Miss PHYLLIS BROUGHTON makes up for rather a weak voice by
    great strength in dancing, and Mr. HARRY MONKHOUSE is genuinely
    comic. Mr. HENRY ASHLEY, always conscientious even in his
    mirth, at the end of the Second Act, is suggestive of the
    Astley's of the Westminster Road. Like the piece, he is very
    well mounted. Madame AMADI is also excellent, a genuine
    lady-comedian&mdash;or should it be <i>com&eacute;dienne</i>?
    Then there is Mr. JOSEPH TAPLEY, a capital tenor, and Mr.
    HAYDEN COFFIN, silver-voiced and graceful, the <i>beau
    id&eacute;al</i> of the hero of a Light Opera company. For the
    rest, the chorus and band could not be better, and the
    production is worthy of DRURIOLANUS, or, rather, CHARLES, his
    brother, and also his friend. So Messrs. BISSON and PLANQUETTE,
    and their English <i>collaborateur</i>, may toast one another,
    happy in the knowledge that the <i>entente cordiale</i> has
    once more received hearty confirmation at the hands of the
    London public; they may cry, with reason, <i>Vive la
    France!</i> and Hip, hip, BRITANNIA! feeling sure that, by
    their joint exertions, they have obtained for the Anglo-Saxon
    race that blessing to the public in general, and Theatrical
    Managers in particular, a lasting piece.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
